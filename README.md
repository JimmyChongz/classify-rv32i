# Assignment 2: Classify
### Part A Mathematical Functions
#### Task 1: ReLU
In this part, we need to iterate through the entire input array. For each element in the array that is less than zero, we should change it to zero, ensuring that all elements in the input array are non-negative.

#### Tsak 2: ArgMax
In this approach, we assume the first element of the input array is the maximum number, so we start iterating from the second element. To find the maximum number in the array, we compare each element with the current maximum value. If any element is larger than the current maximum, we update the maximum value accordingly. This process continues until we have iterated through the entire array.
